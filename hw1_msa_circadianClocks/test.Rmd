## Part 1: 

### Question 1: 3 pts

##### Provide an image of your alignment. 

![clustalW](attachment:clustalW_align.pdf){width=100%}

##### Are there some parts of the sequence that do not appear as well-aligned as others, or where the sequences just look very different from one another? 

Broadly speaking, the tail end of the sequence is poorly conserved across all sequences, as well as a chunk of sequence early on in the FrogI species, some sort of insertion in the middle/end of the InsectJ species, and a messy area in the second block of sequence for all species.

##### Which of the sequences looks the most different, and what is different about it?

I would say that InsectJ looks the most distinct as it does contain a long insertion of some kind in the fifth chunk of sequences in this image.

### Question 2: 2 pts

##### Provide an image of your new Clustal-Omega alignment.

![image-4.png](attachment:image-4.png)

##### Can you see any differences between this alignment and the clustal-W alignment?

Yes! The FrogI species is aligned differently in the beginning of this sequence (with missing gaps in the front end of the sequence instead of a few letters in as in ClustalW.
