### Introduction

### Methods

  I collected whole mitochondrial genome access numbers for GenBank **citation** from Miya et. al and although there is some debate regarding the relationships among Lophiiformes and other ray-finned fishes, I used this same paper as a reference when assessing the performance of my tree building models. Whole genome access numbers were not all in use when I collected them from the paper, and I wanted to use individual loci within the genome, so I used the whole mitogenome access numbers as a jumping off point to narrow down the species I wanted to work with. Gene reference numbers for each locus and species can be found in **supplement1**.
  
  To quantify depth tolerance for each species, I consulted FishBase, an internationally maintained fish database hosted by Q-quatics **citation**. For each species, FishBase provides a range of depths individuals are found. Because I intended to consider depth tolerance, I selected the maximum known depth per species (**table1**).
  
Alignments were performed using MUSCLE in accordance with methods approached by Banon et. al in their paper on the efficacy of DNA barcoding in Lophiiformes **citation** 

### Results

## evolutionary rates
all 13 loci failed the clockwise assumption
